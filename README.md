# Algorithm-and-DataStructure
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of algorithms and data structures that I have studied and implemented throughout my learning journey in computer science. It includes various fundamental concepts, techniques, and examples, designed to help improve problem-solving skills and deepen understanding of algorithmic principles.

## Projects

### Project 1: Bipartite Graph

- **Overview**: This project focuses on building a bipartite graph and checking its properties by coloring it. A graph is bipartite if the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.
- **Techniques**: Graph construction, BFS/DFS traversal, graph coloring.

### Project 2: BruteForce A Hashed Sentence Program

- **Overview**: Implements a brute force algorithm to reverse a hashed sentence. This project is an exploration of brute force techniques for string manipulation and hashing.
- **Techniques**: String manipulation, brute force algorithms, hash functions.

### Project 3: Fixed Document Python Program

- **Overview**: This program fixes numerical disorientation within a document, ensuring correct numerical order and format. It automates the correction of numeric sequences that may be jumbled or out of order.
- **Techniques**: File handling, regular expressions, string manipulation.

### Project 4: Hamiltonian Tour

- **Overview**: Solves the Hamiltonian Tour problem, where the goal is to find a tour that visits every vertex in a graph exactly once and returns to the starting point. The project tests and evaluates the performance of different algorithms in solving this NP-hard problem.
- **Techniques**: Graph traversal, backtracking, optimization.

### Project 5: M_Queen Problem

- **Overview**: Solves the M-Queen problem, a generalized version of the famous N-Queens problem, which involves placing `m` queens on an `m x m` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. The project also includes performance testing on my laptop.
- **Techniques**: Backtracking, constraint satisfaction, performance benchmarking.

### Project 6: Prime vs Kruskal Algorithm Performance

- **Overview**: Compares the performance of Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph. This project evaluates both algorithms in terms of time complexity and performance on various graph structures.
- **Techniques**: Graph theory, Prim’s algorithm, Kruskal’s algorithm, performance comparison.

### Project 7: Traveling Salesman Problem Solution for `n` Nodes

- **Overview**: Solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for `n` nodes by generating random nodes and a depot within a specified area, with a density parameter to control node distribution. The project includes two main modules:
  1. **Node Generation**: Generates random nodes and a depot within an area.
  2. **Clustering & Routing**: Clusters nodes based on the number of salesman agents and routes them through an optimal trajectory from the depot to the assigned destinations and back.
- **Techniques**: K-means clustering, TSP heuristics, graph traversal, optimization, routing algorithms.
